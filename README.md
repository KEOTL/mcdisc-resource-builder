======================

This is a simple automated resource pack builder for the Minecraft Discs mod. See [mcdisc](https://github.com/KEOTL/mcdisc).

## Download the builder executable
Windows: [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/keotl/mcdisc-resource-builder/build/artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/keotl/mcdisc-resource-builder/build/artifacts) (Click of mcdisc-resource-builder.zip)

MacOS: (Coming soon)

## Setup
1. Download the builder for your operating system. (See above)
2. Double click on the executable corresponding to your operating system. (Confirmed working on Windows 10, macOS High Sierra, Ubuntu 17.10). If you run into issues, try running from source. (See below.)
3. Enter your disc list location in the text box. Can be either a URL, or a local file. NoteÂ : While building, the window will freeze. This is normal, and will unfreeze when the pack has been created.
4. Copy the created mcdisc-resource-pack.zip into your minecraft resource packs folder.
5. Enable the resource pack from the in-game menu.
